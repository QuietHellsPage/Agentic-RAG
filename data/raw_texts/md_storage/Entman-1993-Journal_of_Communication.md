# **Framing: Toward Clarification of a** **Fractured Paradigm**

by Robert M. Entman, Northwestern University


In response to the proposition that communication lacks disciplinary status because of deficient core knowledge, I propose that we turn an ostensible weakness into a strength. We should identify our mission as bringing together insights and theories that would otherwise remain scattered
in other disciplines. Because of the lack of interchange among the disciplines, hypotheses thoroughly discredited in one field may receive wide
acceptance in another. Potential research paradigms remain fractured,
with pieces here and there but no comprehensive statement to guide research. By bringing ideas together in one location, communication can
aspire to become a master discipline that synthesizes related theories and
concepts and exposes them to the most rigorous, comprehensive statement and exploration. Reaching this goal would require a more self-conscious determination by communication scholars to plumb other fields
and feed back their studies to outside researchers. At the same time, such
an enterprise would enhance the theoretical rigor of communication
scholarship proper.
The idea of “framing” offers a case study of just the kind of scattered
conceptualization I have identified. Despite its omnipresence across the
social sciences and humanities, nowhere is there a general statement of
framing theory that shows exactly how frames become embedded within
and make themselves manifest in a text, or how framing influences thinking. Analysis of this concept suggests how the discipline of communication might contribute something unique: synthesizing a key concept’s disparate uses, showing how they invariably involve communication, and
constructing a coherent theory from them.
Whatever its specific use, the concept of framing consistently offers a
way to describe the power of a communicating text. Analysis of frames illuminates the precise way in which influence over a human consciousness is exerted by the transfer (or communication) of information from

one location-such as a speech, utterance, news report, or novel-to that
consciousness. (A representative list of classic and recent citations would
include: Edelman, 1993; Entman & Rojecki, 1993; Fiske & Taylor, 1991;
Gamson, 1992; Goffman, 1974; Graber, 1988; Iyengar, 1991; Kahneman &
Tversky, 1984; Pan & Kosicki, 1993; Riker, 1986; Snow & Benford, 1988;
Tuchman, 1978; White, 1987; Zaller, 1992.) **A** literature review suggests
that framing is often defined casually, with much left to an assumed tacit
understanding of reader and researcher. After all, the words _frame, fram-_
_ing,_ and _.framework_ are common outside of formal scholarly discourse,
and their connotation there is roughly the same. The goal here is to identify and make explicit common tendencies among the various uses of the
terms and to suggest a more precise and universal understanding of them.


**Of Frames and Framing**


Framing essentially involves _selection_ and _salience._ To frame is to _select_
_some aspects of aperceived reality and make them more salient in a com-_
_municating text, in such a way as to promote aparticularproblem defini-_
_tion, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recom-_
_mendation_ for the item described. Typically frames diagnose, evaluate,
and prescribe, a point explored most thoroughly by Gamson (1992). An
example is the “cold war” frame that dominated U.S. news of foreign affairs until recently. The cold war frame highlighted certain foreign
events-say, civil wars-as problems, identified their source (communist
rebels), offered moral judgments (atheistic aggression), and commended
particular solutions (U.S. support for the other side).
Frames, then, _dejineproblems-determine_ what a causal agent is doing
with what costs and benefits, usually measured in terms of common cultural values; _diagnose_ causes-identify the forces creating the problem;
_make moraljudgments-evaluate_ causal agents and their effects; and
_suggest remedies-offer_ and justify treatments for the problems and predict their likely effects. A single sentence may perform more than one of
these four framing functions, although many sentences in a text may perform none of them. And a frame in any particular text may not necessarily
include all four functions.
The cold war example also suggests that frames have at least four locations in the communication process: the communicator, the text, the receiver, and the culture. _Communicators_ make conscious or unconscious
framing judgments in deciding what to say, guided by frames (often
called schemata) that organize their belief systems. The _text_ contains
frames, which are manifested by the presence or absence of certain keywords, stock phrases, stereotyped images, sources of information, and
sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or judgments. The frames that guide the _receiver’s_ thinking and conclusion may
or may not reflect the frames in the text and the framing intention of the

communicator. The _culture_ is the stock of commonly invoked frames; in
fact, culture might be defined as the empirically demonstrable set of common frames exhibited in the discourse and thinking of most people in a
social grouping. Framing in a11 four locations includes similar functions:
selection and highlighting, and use of the highlighted elements to construct an argument about problems and their causation, evaluation,
and/or solution.


**How Frames Work**


Frames highlight some bits of information about an item that is the subject of a communication, thereby elevating them in salience. The word
## salience itself needs to be defined: It means making :i piece of informa
tion more noticeable, meaningful, or memorable to audiences. An increase in salience enhances the probability that receivers will perceive
the information, discern meaning and thus process it, and store it in meniory (see Fiske & Taylor, 1991).
Texts can make bits of information more salient by placement or repetition, or by associating them with culturally familiar symbols. However,
even a single nnillustrated appearance of a notion in an obscure part of
the text can be highly salient, if it comports with the existing schemata in
a receiver’s belief systems. By the same token, an idea emphasized in a
text can be difficult for receivers to notice, interpret, or remember because of their existing schemata. For our purposes, schemata and closely
related concepts such as categories, scripts, or stereotypes connote mentally stored clusters of ideas that guide individuals’ processing of information (see, e.g., Graber, 19881. Because salience is a product of the interaction of texts and receivers, the presence of frames in the text, as detected
by researchers, does not guarantee their influence in audience thinking
(Entman, 1989; Graber, 1988).
Kahneman and Tversky _(1984)_ offer perhaps the most widely cited recent example o f the power of framing and the way it operates by selecting and highlighting some features of reality while omitting others. The
authors asked experimental subjects the following:


_Imagine thal the 1J.S._ _**`is`**_ _preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian_
_disease, which is expected to kill 600people. Two alternative programs_
_to combat the disease have beenproposed. Assume that the exact scien-_
_tz$c_ _estimates_ _of_ _the consequences qftheprograms are as,follows: I f Pro-_
_gram A is adopted, 200people will be saved. Ifprogram B is adopted,_
_there is a one-thirdprobability that GOOpeople will be saved and a two-_
_thirdsprohahility that no people will he saved. Which_ _of_ _the twopro-_
_grams wouldyou favor?(1984,_ p. _243)_


In this experiment, 72 percent of subjects chose Program A; 28 percent


53


_,/ournal_ _of_ _Communication, Autumn 199.3_


chose Program B. In the next experiment, _identical options_ to treating the
same described situation were offered, but framed in terms of likely
deaths rather than likely lives saved: “If Program C is adopted, _400_ people
will die. If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that 600 people will die”
(Kahneman & Tversky, _1984,_ p. 343). The percentages choosing the options were reversed by the framing. Program C was chosen by _22_ percent,
though its twin Program **A** was selected by _72_ percent; and Program D
garnered _78_ percent, while the identical Program B received only _28_ percent.
**As** this example vividly illustrates, the frame determines whether most
people notice and how they understand and remember a problem, as
well as how they evaluate and choose to act upon it. The notion of framing thus implies that the frame has a common effect on large portions of
the receiving audience, though it is not likely to have a universal effect on
all.
Kahneman and Tversky’s experiments demonstrate that frames select
and call attention to particular aspects of the reality described, which logically means that frames simultaneously direct attention away from other
aspects. Most frames are defined by what they omit as well as include,
and the omissions of potential problem definitions, explanations, evaluations, and recommendations may be as critical as the inclusions in guiding the audience.

Edelman highlights the way frames exert their power through the selective description and omission of the features of a situation:


_The character, causes, and consequences of any phenomenon become_
_radically different as changes are made in what is prominently dis-_
_played, what is repressed and especially in how observations are classi-_
_jied._ . . . _(Uhe social world is_ . . . _a kaleidoscope ofpotential realities,_
_any_ _of_ _which can be readily evoked by altering the ways in which obser-_
_vations are framed and categorized._ (1993, p. 232)


Receivers’ responses are clearly affected if they perceive and process information about one interpretation and possess little or incommensurable
data about alternatives. This is why exclusion of interpretations by frames
is as significant to outcomes as inclusion.
Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock (1991) provide a clear instance of the
power of presence and absence in framing:


_The effect of framing is toprime values differentially, establishing the_
_salience of the one or the other. (Thus]._ . . _a majority of thepublic sup-_
_ports the rights ofpersons with AIDS when the issue is framed (in a sur-_
_vey question] to accentuate civil liberties considerations-and_ _supports_
. . . _mandatory testing when the issue is framed to accentuatepublic_
_health considerations._ (p. _52)_

The text of the survey question supplies most people with the considerations they use when they respond to the issue of AIDS testing (Zaller,
1992). Often a potential counterframing of the subject is mostly or wholly
absent from a text, although, to use this instance, an audience member
with a strong civil liberties philosophy might reject mandatory testing
even if the poll framed AIDS strictly in public health terms.


_Frames in Political News_
This portrait of framing has important implications for political communication. Frames call attention to some aspects of reality while obscuring
other elements, which might lead audiences to have different reactions.
Politicians seeking support are thus compelled to compete with each
other and with journalists over news frames (Entman, 1989; Riker, 1986).
Framing in this light plays a major role in the exertion of political power,
and the frame in a news text is really the imprint of power-it registers
the identity of actors or interests that competed to dominate the text.

Reflecting the play of power and boundaries of discourse over an issue,

many news texts exhibit homogeneous framing at one level of analysis,
yet competing frames at another. Thus, in the pre-war debate over U.S.
policy toward Iraq, there was a tacit consensus among U.S. elites not to
argue for such options as negotiation between Iraq and Kuwait. The news
frame included only two remedies, war now or sanctions now with war
(likely) later, while problem definitions, causal analyses, and moral evaluations were homogeneous. Between the selected remedies, however,
framing was contested by elites, and news coverage offered different sets
of facts and evaluations. The Iraq example reveals that the power of news
frames can be self-reinforcing. During the pre-war debate, any critique
transcending the remedies inside the frame (war soon versus more time
for sanctions) breached the bounds of acceptable discourse, hence was
unlikely to influence policy. By conventional journalistic standards, such
views were not newsworthy (Entman & Page, in press). Unpublicized, the
views could gain few adherents and generate little perceived or actual effect on public opinion, which meant elites felt no pressure to expand the
frame _so_ it included other treatments for Iraqi aggression, such as negotiation. Relatedly, Gamson (1992) observes that a frame can exert great _so-_
cial power when encoded in a term like _ajfirmatiue action._ Once a term
is widely accepted, to use another is to risk that target audiences will perceive the communicator as lacking credibility-or will even fail to understand what the communicator is talking about. Thus the power of a frame
can be as great as that of language itself.


**Benefits of a Consistent Concept of Framing**


An understanding of frames helps illuminate many empirical and normative controversies, most importantly because the concept of framing di

55


_Journal_ _**`of`**_ _Communication, Autumn 1993_



rects our attention to the details of just how a communicated text exerts
its power. The example o f mass communication explored here suggests
how a common understanding might help constitute framing as a _re-_
_search paradigm._ **A** research paradigm is defined here as a general theory
that informs most scholarship on the operation and outcomes of any particular system of thought and action. The framing paradigm could be applied with similar benefits to the study of public opinion and voting behavior in political science; to cognitive studies in social psychology; or to
class, gender, and race research in cultural studies and sociology, to name
a few. Here are some illustrations of theoretical debates in the study of
mass communication that would benefit from an explicit and common
understanding of the concept of frames.



1. _Audience autonomy._ The concept of framing provides an operational



definition for the notion of _dominant meaning_ that is _so_ central to debates about polysemy and audience independence in decoding media
texts (Fiske, 1987). From a framing perspective, dominant meaning consists of the problem, causal, evaluative, and treatment interpretations with
the highest probability of being noticed, processed, and accepted by the
most people. To identify a meaning as dominant or preferred is to suggest
a particular framing of the situation that is most heavily supported by the
text and is congruent with the most common audience schemata.
**A** framing paradigm cautions researchers not to take fugitive components of the message and show how they _might_ be interpreted in ways
that oppose the dominant meaning. If the text frame emphasizes in a variety of mutually reinforcing ways that the glass is half full, the evidence of
social science suggests that relatively few in the audience will conclude it
is half empty. To argue that the polysemic properties of the message conduce to such counterframing, researchers must show that real-world audiences reframe the message, and that this reframing is not a by-product of
the research conditions-for example, a focus group discussion in which
one participant can lead the rest, or a highly suggestive interview protocol (Budd, Entman, & Steinman, 1990).



Certainly people can recall their own facts, forge linkages not made ex


plicitly in the text, or retrieve from memory a causal explanation or cure
that is completely absent from the text. In essence, this is just what professors encourage their students to do habitually. But Zaller (19921, Kahneman and Tversky (19841, and Iyengar (19911, among others, suggest
that on most matters of social or political interest, people are not generally _so_ well-informed and cognitively active, and that framing therefore
heavily influences their responses to communications, although Gamson
(1992) describes conditions that can mitigate this influence.
_**2 .**_ _Journalistic objectivity._ Journalists may follow the rules for “objective” reporting and yet convey a dominant framing of the news text that
prevents most audience members from making a balanced assessment of
a situation. Now, because they lack a common understanding of framing,
journalists frequently allow the most skillful media manipulators to im

_Toward ClariJication_ `of` _a Fractured Paradigm_


pose their dominant frames on the news (Entman, 1989; Entman & Page,
in press; Entman & Rojecki, 1993). If educated to understand the difference between including scattered oppositional facts and challenging a
dominant frame, journalists might be better equipped to construct news
that makes equally salient-equally accessible to the average, inattentive,
and marginally informed audience-two or more interpretations of problems. This task would require a far more active and sophisticated role for
reporters than they now take, resulting in more balanced reporting than
what the formulaic norm of objectivity produces (Tuchman, 1978).
3. _Content analysis._ The major task of determining textual meaning
should be to identify and describe frames; content analysis informed by a
theory of framing would avoid treating all negative or positive terms or
utterances as equally salient and influential. Often, coders simply tote up
all messages they judge as positive and negative and draw conclusions
about the dominant meanings. They neglect to measure the salience of elements in the text, and fail to gauge the relationships of the most salient
clusters of messages-the frames-to the audience’s schemata. Unguided
by a framing paradigm, content analysis may often yield data that misrepresent the media messages that most audience members are actually picking up.
_4. Public opinion and normative democratic theory._ In Zaller’s (1992)
account, framing appears to be a central power in the democratic
process, for political elites control the framing of issues. These frames can
determine just what “public opinion” is-a different frame, according to
Zaller, and survey evidence and even voting can indicate a different public opinion. His theory, along with that of Kahneman and Tversky, seems
to raise radical doubts about democracy itself. If by shaping frames elites
can determine the major manifestations of “true” public opinion that are
available to government (via polls or voting), what can true public opinion be? How can even sincere democratic representatives respond correctly to public opinion when empirical evidence of it appears to be so
malleable, _so_ vulnerable to framing effects?
Say there are three ways to frame an issue and one generates 40 percent approval, the others 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively. **Ap-**
proving the option with 60 percent support is not axiomatically the most
democratic response because of the cyclical majority problem (Riker,
19861, which makes majority rule among several complex options mathematically impossible. Just as important, attempting to determine which of
the differently framed opinions is the closest to the public’s “real” sentiments appears futile, because it would require agreement among contending elites and citizens on which frame was most accurate, fair, complete, and _so_ forth. **A** framing paradigm can illuminate, if not solve, such
central puzzles in normative democratic theory.
Indeed, the concept of framing is important enough in the many fields
of inquiry that use it to merit a book-length essay. The present effort, constrained by space limitations, offers not the definitive word on frames but

a preliminary contribution. Equally important, this article exemplifies
how the field of communication might develop from its wide ambit and
eclectic approaches a core of knowledge that could translate into research paradigms contributing to social theory in the largest sense.
